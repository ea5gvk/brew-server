//! Federation routing: the loop-safe route exchange between brew-servers, and
//! de-duplication of calls and SDS that reach a server more than once.
//!
//! Negotiation. Loop-safe federation is agreed per peer link at connect time,
//! only between servers that both enable `[federation] loop_safe`: the
//! dialling side sends `X-Brew-Federation: 1` and its `X-Brew-Server-Id` on
//! the WebSocket upgrade, and the accepting side answers with its own in the
//! `101`. Anyone else -- an older brew-server, another Brew server, a
//! Basestation -- ignores the headers and does not echo them, so its link
//! stays a plain one. `FedState::links` holds the negotiated links; nothing of
//! class `protocol::CLASS_FEDERATION` is ever sent on any other connection.
//!
//! Route table. On a negotiated link registrations do not travel as relayed
//! SUB messages but as path-vector route adverts (`FED_ROUTE`/`FED_WITHDRAW`):
//! the ISSI, its registration clock at the origin server (`reg`, a hybrid
//! logical clock -- see `FedState::tick`), the servers it crossed (`path`,
//! sender first, origin last) and its groups. Each server keeps every
//! neighbour's current offer (`FedState::rib_in`) next to its own local
//! registrations and picks, per ISSI, the origin with the newest registration
//! (tie: higher server id) and the shortest path to it (`select`). Only that
//! choice -- the effective route -- is kept in `Inner::subscribers` and
//! `Inner::group_clients`, so call, SDS, SIP and SMS Center routing need no
//! change; and only a change of it is advertised on (`publish`), with this
//! server's id put in front. Nobody accepts a path holding its own id, so
//! adverts cannot loop whatever the topology (ring, full mesh, redundant
//! links), and when a link drops (`state::cleanup_client`) every ISSI routed
//! or offered over it fails over to the next best offer or is withdrawn. A
//! legacy peer link (an older server, or `loop_safe = false`) still gets SUB
//! messages, derived from the same effective table, and whatever it sends
//! counts as registered at this server -- so such a peer must hang off the
//! mesh by a single link: a cycle through it is not loop-safe.
//!
//! Call/SDS de-duplication: in any federation topology with more than one
//! path between two servers (a ring, a mesh, two links between the same pair)
//! the same GROUP_TX, private SETUP_REQUEST or SDS header can reach a server
//! more than once, over different peer links. Without a check the second copy
//! would take the call over (new owner, forwarded again) and could circulate
//! forever. Each copy is keyed by (uuid, source ISSI): a talker change inside
//! a group call reuses the uuid with another source ISSI and must still be
//! accepted. A server that drops a duplicate GROUP_TX from a loop-safe link
//! answers `FED_PRUNE`, and the sender stops feeding that link the call's
//! voice: one stream per server, not one per redundant link.
