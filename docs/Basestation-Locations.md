# Basestation Locations

The `/map` page plots every Basestation as a radio-mast marker (blue when
connected, grey when offline) next to the mobile terminals (orange handheld
radio). A Basestation's position comes from, in order of precedence:

1. **The Basestation itself**, over telemetry (recommended).
2. **Another brew-server**, relayed over federation.
3. **`[bts_locations]`** in `brew-server.toml`, a static fallback for any
   Basestation that reports no position.

A Basestation covered by 1 or 2 never also shows its static entry.

## Reporting the position from Bost FlowStation

Add the position to the `[telemetry]` section of the FlowStation config:

```toml
[telemetry]
host = "brew.example.com"
port = 443
# ...
site_name = "Athens Hill"   # optional, shown on the map
latitude  = 37.9917         # decimal degrees, -90..90
longitude = 23.7640         # decimal degrees, -180..180
```

- Set both `latitude` and `longitude`, or neither. Values out of range are
  rejected when the config loads.
- **Nothing is sent when the position is unset or `0.0` / `0.0`.** The empty
  position is never transmitted or plotted.
- The position is sent when it changes and **re-sent every 60 seconds**, in
  case the server missed it. After a telemetry reconnect the marker can take up
  to a minute to appear.
- The same telemetry link also carries MCC / MNC, shown in the cell header
  (`MCC 202 / MNC 1 / CC 1 / LA 2`) on the dashboard. Older FlowStation builds
  do not send them and the header shows only CC / LA.

The map matches a Basestation to its static entry by the telemetry login name,
so for the fallback to be replaced cleanly it must equal the Brew username.

## Relay between brew-servers

With `[federation] loop_safe = true`, a brew-server passes the positions of its
own Basestations, and those it learned, on to its federation peers:

- **Both servers must set `loop_safe = true`** in `[federation]`, including a
  server that only accepts the link (it may keep `enabled = false`) -- see
  [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting-positions-not-relayed). With it set on
  only one end the link stays a plain one and no positions cross it.
- Positions travel as `FED_BTS` messages. A link first sends `FED_BTS_HELLO`;
  positions go **only to peers that announced support**. Older peers and
  legacy (non loop-safe) links receive nothing.
- Every advert carries the servers it crossed, and a server never accepts one
  that went through it, so rings and meshes cannot loop. Each server forwards a
  given advert at most once.
- The origin refreshes a live position at least every 30 seconds of telemetry
  traffic and withdraws it when the Basestation's telemetry disconnects.
- A learned position not refreshed for 2 minutes is dropped, which is how a
  lost link or a dead origin server is noticed.
- A newly connected peer is sent everything currently known.
- Not replicated to an HA Standby: it rebuilds from reconnecting Basestations
  and peer refreshes after a failover.

## Static fallback

```toml
[bts_locations."1000001"]   # the Brew username the Basestation logs in as
name = "Athens HQ"
lat = 37.9917
lon = 23.7640
```

Also editable under Settings. A `0` / `0` entry is treated as not configured
and is not plotted.

## Troubleshooting: positions not relayed

A Basestation position shows on the server it reports to but not on its peer:

1. **`loop_safe` on both servers.** The dialling server (`[[federation.peers]]`)
   and the accepting one both need:

   ```toml
   [federation]
   loop_safe = true
   ```

   The accepting side can keep `enabled = false`. Restart after changing it.
   Switching a link to loop-safe also changes how subscriber registrations
   are exchanged (route adverts instead of plain subscriber messages), so
   check calls between the sites afterwards.
2. **Same build on both.** A server without this feature ignores the messages.
3. **Check the logs.**
   - `federation: peer link established` with an empty `loop_safe_neighbour`
     means a plain link (see 1).
   - `federation: peer supports Basestation positions; synced` on each side
     means the relay is active.
   - Debug log on the origin: `Basestation position not relayed: no peer link
     announced support`.
4. **The Basestation must report a position** (`latitude` / `longitude` in its
   `[telemetry]`, not 0 / 0) and its telemetry must be connected.
5. **Mobile terminal positions are not relayed**, only Basestation ones.
